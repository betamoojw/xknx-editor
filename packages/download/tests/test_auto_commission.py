"""Full-download commissioning of a virgin device.

A device that was never programmed still answers on the default address, not on its
configured one, so a point-to-point download to the configured address gets no ACK. A
``FULL`` download with ``commission=True`` first writes the configured address to the
single device in programming mode (only when nothing already answers there), then runs
the load procedure. Partial scopes never commission.
