"""Regression test: the lazy view caches (devices / topology / group addresses) must invalidate
independently.

They used to share a single ``_cache_version``. After an edit, whichever cache was read first
rebuilt and stamped the shared version, so the *other* caches then saw ``version ==`` and returned
stale data until the next edit. Reading ``devices`` right after adding a group address, for example,
hid the new GA from ``group_addresses``.
